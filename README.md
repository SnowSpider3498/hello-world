# hello-world
time-honored tradition

I am a recent college graduate failing to get a job/trying to figure out my path. In short, I am starting to learn some new skills, including web-development, so that I can kickstart my post-graduate life. I love sports, music, films, and I wish I could be a rich superhero. Also, like to travel a ton and learn stuff. Always wanted to learn coding, so I'm excited. I'm 97% sure no one will ever read this - but, I'll probably update it like a blog for my own personal enjoyment. Fun! 

ok. Signing off. 30/06/17
